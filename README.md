# Norin

A test implementation of a Minecraft server using RESTful API taking advantage of the interoperability between Kotlin and Java.

This project is made only for testing and educational purposes, and since setting this goal, I removed many things from the repository which would be essential if you want to run this server as a large-scale project.
